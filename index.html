    <div class="history">  
      <p>My first encounter with pilates was in my mid-20s. I was dancing professionally and I had chronic achilles tendinitis. My chiropractor at the time suggested I take some time off from dance and take yoga and Pilates. I did as she said. Yoga came easily to me. Because I was a dancer, with the exception of handstands, I could do most everything. Pilates was a completely different story. It was surprisingly hard. There were many things my body couldn’t figure out how to do. Better yet, I was shaking like a leaf to do an exercise that seemed quite remedial. Humbling as it was, this is why I grew to appreciate it so much. I was connecting to my body in a way I never had before; accessing new muscles and using the old ones differently to create a whole new synergy in my body.</p> 
      <p>Because Pilates works on alignment, one’s imbalances are revealed. One’s compensation are revealed, and therefore, so are one’s weaknesses. But with practice, your body starts to find a new groove. The shaking stops. The movement is fluid and strong. Then, you add a challenge and the shaking starts all over again. This is the Pilates practice.</p> 
      <p>Now in my 50s, I appreciate pilates more than ever. The one thing I tell my clients is certain is that we are all losing space in our bodies. It’s inevitable. But, with the use of spring resistance and the strengthening of deeper core muscles, pilates allows me to hang on to that space. And when there’s more space, there’s an increase in range of motion. Movement becomes more efficient, more available. Pain subsides.</p>
      <p>I received my certification in the Ron Fletcher technique, which is classical pilates, back in 1999.  Since then I have grown and evolved as an instructor. I have had the privilege of working alongside many gifted practitioners and taken workshops from master trainers.  And, still I have learned and continue to learn from my clients. Every body has it’s own history. It is my job to figure out how to coach you, the individual, through an injury or through a workout. Picking the right exercises, correct sequencing and coaching such that you, the individual, can absorb it into your body is the key. And, it is what I love most about my job.</p>
